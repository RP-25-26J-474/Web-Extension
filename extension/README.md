### Technologies Used

#### Backend
- **Node.js & Express** - Server framework
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** - Database and ODM
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** - Authentication
- **bcryptjs** - Password hashing
- **CORS** - Cross-origin resource sharing

#### Extension
- **Manifest V3**: Modern extension format
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external dependencies
- **Chrome Storage API**: Local data caching
- **Service Workers**: Background processing
- **Content Scripts**: Page interaction tracking
- **Fetch API**: Backend communication

### Permissions Explained

- `storage`: Cache data locally in browser for offline access
- `activeTab`: Access the currently active tab for tracking
- `<all_urls>`: Track interactions across all websites
- `http://localhost:3000/*`: Connect to local development server
- `https://*.yourdomain.com/*`: Connect to production server

### Data Storage

- **Backend Storage**: MongoDB (persistent, searchable)
- **Local Cache**: Chrome Storage API (temporary, for offline mode)
- **Sync Interval**: Every 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Data Retention**: 30 days (auto-deletion)
- **Maximum Storage**: Unlimited (MongoDB)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing, user isolation

### Performance Considerations

- **Throttling**: Mouse movements throttled to 500ms
- **Scroll Events**: Throttled to 1000ms
- **Efficient Storage**: Old data automatically pruned
- **Minimal Impact**: Lightweight event listeners

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### What We Track

✅ Interaction metadata (clicks, keys, movements, hovers, drag & drop, touch events, zoom)  
✅ Page URLs and titles  
✅ Element information (tags, classes, IDs)  
✅ Timestamps  

### What We DON'T Track

❌ Passwords or form field values  
❌ Credit card information  
❌ Personal identifiable information  
❌ Clipboard content  
❌ Authentication tokens  
❌ NO form submissions or form data

### Security Features

- 🔐 **Local storage only** - no network transmission
- 🔐 **Character key masking** - actual characters hidden
- 🔐 **No form data capture** - zero form tracking
- 🔐 **Automatic data expiration** - 7-day retention
- 🔐 **User consent required** - opt-in by default
- 🔐 **Open source** - fully auditable code

For detailed privacy information, see the Privacy Information section in the extension popup.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check if tracking is enabled**
   - Open popup and verify toggle is ON
   - Ensure consent was given

2. **Reload the extension**
   - Chrome: Extensions page → Toggle off/on or Reload

3. **Check browser console**
   - F12 → Console tab
   - Look for error messages

### Data Not Appearing

1. **Refresh the popup**
   - Close and reopen the popup
   - Click the "🔄 Refresh" button

2. **Check storage**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Application/Storage tab → Local Storage
   - Look for extension's storage

### Safari-Specific Issues

1. **Extension not appearing**
   - Safari → Preferences → Extensions
   - Enable the extension

2. **Conversion errors**
   - Ensure you're using Xcode 12+
   - Update to latest macOS

3. **Permissions not working**
   - Re-build in Xcode
   - Check Safari's extension permissions

### Performance Issues

1. **Disable mouse movement tracking**
   - Uncheck "Track Mouse Movements" in popup
   - This reduces event frequency

2. **Clear old data**
   - Click "Clear All Data"
   - Or wait for auto-cleanup (7 days)
